Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

Some newer versions of MacOS use
/private/etc/hosts

cat /etc/hosts

cdn.intra.42.fr
e1z2r5p6% vim net_15
e1z2r5p6% cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

#10.51.1.38 	cdn.intra.42.fr

To change all you would have to do is edit the address to 46.19.122.85 save and possibly flush DNS cache if changes dont work immidiatley
